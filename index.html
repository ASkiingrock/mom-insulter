Third, it tells you a very insulting fact about your mother.<br>

<h5>How can I use this in my own projects?</h5>
<p>The Mum class has two methods, insult() and fact(). You can imagine what these are, I doubt further explanation is required.<br></p>

<p>Currently, this is under discussion. We believe that releasing a product like this for a monetary price would ultimately crash the global economy and we can’t live with the guilt of that.</p>

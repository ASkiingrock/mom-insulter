<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h4>How does it work?</h4>

If you aren’t planning on stealing this highly intelligent wisdom, it is no trouble to share with you the inner workings.<br>

Second, it insults your mother through the highly intelligent system of picking a random yo mama joke.<br>

Third, it tells you a very insulting fact about your mother.<br>
</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<h4>Code licence</h4>
<p>
This highly intelligent code is licenced under <code>CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</code>, we hope you understand that such prestigious code is valuable.<br>
</p>
<h4>How can I use this in my own projects?</h4>
<p>The Mum class has two methods, <code>insult()</code> and <code>fact()</code>. You can imagine what these are, I doubt further explanation is required.<br></p>
<h4>Will you be selling this product?</h4>
<p>Currently, this is under discussion;</p>
<p>We believe that releasing a product like this for a monetary price would ultimately crash the global economy and we can’t live with the guilt of that.</p>
